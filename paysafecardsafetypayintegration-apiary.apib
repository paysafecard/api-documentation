# paysafecard SafetyPay integration

This documentation explains how to start accepting <a href="https://www.safetypay.com/en/">SafetyPay</a> payments. 

It is an add-on to the classic paysafecard integration:


**REST API**: 
<br><br>https://www.paysafecard.com/en/business/downloads/

**SOAP API**: 
<br><br>
https://www.paysafecard.com/en/business/downloads/
<br><br>
https://www.paysafecard.com/fileadmin/api/paysafecardsopg.html

## Group Where to start?
To initiate the process of accepting SafetyPay, the business partner must contact the account manager directly or at [*sales@paysafecard.com*]().
Once the business process is finished, the feature will be activated from paysafecard side. The feature will be activated per MID (Merchant ID).

There are also some technical integration changes necessary, which will be described in detail [here](#technical_changes).

## Introduction
There are alternative payment flows to integrate SafetyPay into your payment ecosystem. In the following section we will describe the general customer flow for each of the alternatives.

2. Transactions must stay open for 48 hours before you can consider them incomplete

3. (Optional) The payment must be created accordingly to the choice of the customer at the checkout page. The integrations supports the usage of choosing the Payment Method during the Payment request. See section [Initiating a SafetyPay Payment - REST](#restrictions_REST) or [Creating a SafetyPay Disposition - SOAP](#restrictions_SOPG)

4. (Optional) Integrating the payment notification payload in JSON 
    * The [JSON payment notification](#payment_notification) enables the business partner to distinguish which payment instrument subtype was used for the transaction.

The array `restrictions` containing the `payment_instrument`, `payment_instrument_subtype` & `bank_ids` parameters gives the possibility to initiate a payment for the specific option chosen by the customer
at the merchant's checkout. When choosing the `payment_instrument`, the customer will be redirected to the SafetyPay payment page immediately.

# Group JSON Payment notification
<a name="payment_notification"></a>
The payment notification is used to notify the business partner independently of the customer’s behaviour after the payment authorization.

This service ensures that payments can be completed before the top-up of the customer’s account and is, therefore, highly recommended in order to avoid incomplete payments.
In case of technical errors (e.g. socket timeout), or application errors (e.g. HTTP 500 response), the payment notification is resubmitted at a regular interval until one of the following criteria is fulfilled:
- The payment notification is successfully delivered (i.e. HTTP 200 response from payment server).
- The maximum number of retry attempts has been reached (currently configured at 5 retries).

A JSON version of the payment notification with all the possible parameters, including the "*payment_instrument*" used, is now available. Example of the body:

```
{
  "timestamp": 1607017210793,
  "eventType": "ASSIGN_CARDS",
  "version": "1",
  "data": {
    "mid": "1100000000",
    "customer": {

# Group Payment processes
<a name="cash_payment_REST_PP"></a>
## Cash Payment process - REST - intermediary paysafecard redirection
1. The customer selects the payment method at the business partner checkout page: paysafecard and/or SafetyPay

1. [Initiate Payment](#initiate_payment): Send POST request `initiate Payment` 
    * 2.1. If the response gives back http20x, the business partner redirects the customer to the payment panel
    * 2.2. If the response gives back http40x or htp50x, show an error message to the customer
        * Inititate Payment error message: "*Transaction could not be intitiated due to connection problems. If the problem persists, please contact our (businessparter)support.*"

1. Redirection to the payment panel `auth_url`: The customer reaches the paysafecard payment panel
    * 3.1. The customer selects SafetyPay Cash Payment
    * 3.2. The customer is redirected to the SafetyPay hosted payment page
    
1. The customer receives a operation ID code
    * 4.1. The customer has to go to a Point of Collection and complete their payment
    
1. Payment notification delivery: A card will be assigned once the customer completes the payment (transaction status "AUTHORIZED"), paysafecard sends a notification to the `notification_url`

1. `notification_url` handling: Right after the payment notification delivery, the business partner performs the GET request `Retrieve payment details` to check the status of the transaction
    * 6.1. If the GET request `retrieve payment details` returns the status "AUTHORIZED", immediately perform the POST request `capture Payment` 
        * 6.2. If the response to `capture payment` is http20X and the status returned is "SUCCESS", the business partner makes a user account top up accordingly or deliver the goods
